### Added 

Added variations on the `Gamma` scenario.

- `gamma_volume_halved`: Storage basins in the `gamma` network are all halved. Test storm remains the same.
- `gamma_1yr_volume_halved`: Storage basins in the `gamma` network are all halved. Test storm for simulation uses a year-long precipitation series.
